# Avoiding Occupancy Detection from Smart Meter using Adversarial Machine Learning and Blockchain

 In this research, my major contributions are twofold. The first one is  that I validate the viability of an occupancy detection attack based on Long Short Term Memory  (LSTM) and a deep neural network methods Then, I compadre the results with a existing research where my findings are outperform than this research. The second one, I introduced an adversarial machine  learning based occupancy detection avoidance (AMODA) framework by providing a new optimization algorithm as an counter attack in order to prevent abuse of consumption.
