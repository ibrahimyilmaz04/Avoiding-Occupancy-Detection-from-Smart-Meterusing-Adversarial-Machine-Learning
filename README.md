# Avoiding Occupancy Detection from Smart Meter using Adversarial Machine Learning and Blockchain

 In this research, my major contributions are twofold. The first one is  that I validate the viability of an occupancy detection attack based on Long Short Term Memory  (LSTM) method and compare the results with a existing research where our findings are outperform than this research. The second one, we introduce an adversarial machine  learning based occupancy detection avoidance (AMODA) framework as an counter attack in order to prevent abuse of consumption.
